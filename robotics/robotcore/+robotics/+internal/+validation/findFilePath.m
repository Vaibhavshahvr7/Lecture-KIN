    %findFilePath Find file according to filePath and return the absolute path
    %   ABSFILEPATH = findFilePath(FILEPATH) searches for the file name
    %   FILEPATH on the MATLAB path and returns the absolute path to the file
    %   in ABSFILEPATH.
    %
    %   FILEPATH can also be specified as a relative path (relative to current
    %   directory) or an absolute path. This function validates the existence
    %   of the file and returns the absolute path to it in ABSFILEPATH.
