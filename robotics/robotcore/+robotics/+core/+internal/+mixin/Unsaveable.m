classdef (Abstract) Unsaveable < handle
    %This class is for internal use only. It may be removed in the future.
    
    %Unsaveable Implements correct behavior for Unsaveable handle objects
    %   Some objects are not designed for being saved to a MAT file and
    %   then reloaded. For example, it might be impossible to reconstruct
    %   the exact state of the object if it was part of a ROS network at
    %   saving time.
    %
    %   The Unsaveable mixin will implement correct saving and loading
    %   behavior for this type of class. It will issue a warning when the
    %   object is saved and ensure that the object handle is deleted when
    %   the object is re-loaded.
    %
    %   To use this mixin, derive your class from Unsaveable and make sure
    %   that your class's delete method is either public or Unsaveable is
    %   part of the access list.
