classdef ModelListSingleton < handle
    %This class is for internal use only. It may be removed in the future.
    
    %ModelListSingleton singleton wrapper for model list.
    %
    %   During interpreted mode, it is assumed that the model definition
    %   xml is constant as it is only used internally.
    %
    %   During code generation, the list would be created in each
    %   getInstance call. Since the whole factory would be constant folded
    %   during code generation, this call doesn't affect generated code.
    %
    %   When user is allowed to create their customized model, it would be
    %   necessary to perform MD5 checks and recreate the model list when
    %   necessary. Or user would need to reinitialize the singleton
    %   instance explicity after changing the model file (for example:
    %   clear classes)
    %
    %   During MATLAB execution, the list would only be created once
    %   until changes are made to the model defintion xml.
