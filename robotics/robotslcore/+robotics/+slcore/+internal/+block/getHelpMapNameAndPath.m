function [mapName, relativePathToMapFile, found] = getHelpMapNameAndPath(block_type, blks, tbxList)
%This function is for internal use only. It may be removed in the future.

%getHelpMapNameAndPath  Returns the mapName and the relative path to the
%   maps file for this block_type, with the mapping defined by BLKS
%
%   BLKS input:
%    First column is the "System object name", corresponding to the block, 
%    Second column is the anchor ID, the doc uses for the block.
%    For core blocks, the first column is the 'BlockType'.
%
%   TBXLIST input
%    List of toolboxes to check for installation status. This input becomes
%    important if blocks are shared between different toolbox (can ship in
%    either one), so that the right MAP file is picked for the user's
%    installation.
